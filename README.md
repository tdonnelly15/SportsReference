### Created With Python 3.14.2
#### The code I created reads the json file from a local path (path may have be changed depending on file location). It uses the json.load commands to organize the information in dictionary format. The teams are then pulled from the data. It then creates the column width using the length of each team abbreviation plus 2 spaces for formatting. The header is created by iterating and adding each team name to a string. Each team is aligned to the left using the column width. Finally, the rows are created by iterating through each team. The opponent is also iterated through within this loop. If the opponent and team are the same, the cell will display "-". For all other matchups, the record for each specific matchup is then pulled from the data and inserted in that cell. The rows are printed by team in starting with Brooklyn and ending with St.Louis.
